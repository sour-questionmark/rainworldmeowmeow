IDK IDK IDK what do i say just CALL ME i give advice yea yea. e Due to my strong personal convictions (Due to my strong personal convictions) I wish to stress (I wish to stress) That this website (that this website) In no way endorses (in no way endorses) A belief in the occult (a belief in the occult) Before the events of Rain World, there existed a people commonly referred to as the Ancients. Within their society, there existed monks who sought to escape the cycle of death and rebirth that trapped every living creature. These monks believed that there existed five natural urges, which bound every living creature to this cycle, and that if they shed each one, they could cross themselves out for good. The Ancients were immersed in all things sentimental, as well as those cerebral. They created art in the form of poetry, song, and craft, and likely interested themselves in discussions, debates, and documenting their living qualia. There were likely many strata of influence an Ancient could find themselves in, and there existed an intricate system of titles and honorifics that was present in their official communications. This was a society that proved to be spiritual, artistic, and ambitious to a fault. lOL they kinda sound dumb thank god i wasnt alive back when THEYYYY were L LL L L L L L LLLLL From the Void Fluid Revolution came the Iterators: massive, freestanding computers imbued with great processing power. They played many roles in the upkeep of Ancient society, but one of their purposes was to discover a solution to ascension. This solution needed to apply to all living creatures, and provide them with a way to leave the cycle of death and rebirth; however, this problem appears to remain unsolved by the events of Rain World. The water consumption of the Iterators is immense, and the exhaust of this water as vapor is equally great, so as more Iterators were constructed, the surface of the world was transformed by the rain they made. The surface became uninhabitable, so the Ancients moved their cities and settlements on top of their Iteratorsâ€™ structures. As technology grew, the collection of Void Fluid likely did as well. Prices of Void Fluid baths had started becoming cheaper, and populations had likely started to decrease. thanks wiki the iterators still suck. tho. fuck u five pebbles ur pebbsi cola is shit and your catboy outfit looks horrible i hate u u fevi pebbles i hate the void sea also ermmm wawaawawaawwawawaawwa I feel so unsure As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor As the music dies, something in your eyes Calls to mind a silver screenAnd all its sad good-byes I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool I should've known better than to cheat a friend And waste the chance that I'd been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you, oh Time can never mend The careless whispers of a good friend To the heart and mind Ignorance is kind There's no comfort in the truth Pain is all you'll find I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool I should've known better than to cheat a friend (should've known better, yeah) And waste the chance that I'd been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you, oh Never without your love Tonight the music seems so loud I wish that we could lose this crowd Maybe it's better this way We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say GOOD SONG GOO D SONG it fits me i love singing it whever i see a hot BABE BUY MY STUFF OR I WILL FIND U .
